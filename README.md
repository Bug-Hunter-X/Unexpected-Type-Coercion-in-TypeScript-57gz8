This example demonstrates a subtle type coercion issue in TypeScript that can lead to runtime errors. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers and return a number, however, it does not explicitly check that the inputs are numbers. The type system allows the function to execute without throwing a compile-time error, but a runtime error will be caused by type coercion. The solution involves adding stricter type checking to the function parameters.
